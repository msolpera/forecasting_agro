# 📈 Commodity Price Forecasting

This project aims to forecast prices of key agricultural commodities — **soybeans, wheat, and beef** — using various time series modeling approaches. It compares classical, statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models to determine the most accurate one.

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/forecasting_agro.git
cd forecasting_agro
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the main notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

## 📊 Methodology

Each model is developed and tested in its respective notebook inside the `notebooks/` folder. There, hyperparameters are tuned, model performance is evaluated, and predictions are visualized.

In `main.ipynb`, results from all models are compiled and compared to choose the best-performing one.

Evaluation metrics:

- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

---

## Final Comparison

The final model selection is based on error metrics and prediction performance on the test set.
